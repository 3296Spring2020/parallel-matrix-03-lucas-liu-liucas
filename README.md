Contributions:
Mark completed the day one task of running matrix multiplication non-vectorized in C as well as creating a vectorized version.
Mark also completed the Matrix multiplication parallelization in Java.

Stephen worked on the automation of different matrix sizes for testing and data collection. Contributed to implementing the output to textfiles for data collection and graphing. Created the graphs from data to compare the different algorithm's time complexities. Debugging algorithm errors, especially with the MPI algorithms.

When wanting to review each other's work we would voice chat and screenshare, so we could see exactly what was happening with the changes being made.

We used a project board on Trello. We used it to keep track of everything required for the project and delegate work to the group. It also helped us keep track of what deliverables we have completed. To test we looped through a range of matrix sizes (100-2000) and collected data on exectution time of our different algorithms. We did consider the code from the professor might have flaws, and we did end up modifying it. We wrote code in our methods to generate random matricies of different sizes. This is implemented in our code successfully.We planned the work needed to generate graphs. We automated the data collection, not the graphing. 

It took much planning and testing for our developed algorithms, and it took a fair amount of time writing the algorithms. Overall, more time was spent planning, testing, and debugging compared to the actual writing of code. The typical cycle of :write, compile, run, test code was thrown off a bit with this project. Requiring development to be on Wolfgand cluster through off our typical coding environment, so we were forced to adapt.
