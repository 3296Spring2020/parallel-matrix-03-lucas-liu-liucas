Mark completed the day one task of running matrix multiplication non-vectorized in C as well as creating a vectorized version.
Mark also completed the Matrix multiplication parallelization in Java.

Stephen worked on the automation of different matrix sizes for testing and data collection. Contributed to implementing the output to textfiles for data collection and graphing. Created the graphs from data to compare the different algorithm's time complexities. Debugging algorithm errors, especially with the MPI algorithms.

When wanting to review each other's work we would voice chat and screenshare, so we could see exactly what was happening with the changes being made.

The typical cycle of :write, compile, run, test code was thrown off a bit with this project.  Requiring development to be on Wolfgand cluster through off our
typical coding environment, so we were forced to adapt.
